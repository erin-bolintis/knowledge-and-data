    "\n",
    "Description and Motivation:\n",
    "In this axiom, we assert that \"ItemA\" has two managers, \"ManagerJohn\" and \"ManagerSarah.\" This axiom introduces a contradiction because you previously specified the \"hasManager\" property as an \"Inverse Functional Property,\" which means each item can have only one manager. \n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation of Inconsistency:\n",
    "The inconsistency arises from the violation of the \"Inverse Functional Property\" characteristic. By asserting that \"ItemA\" has both \"ManagerJohn\" and \"ManagerSarah\" as managers, we contradict the ontology's constraint that enforces a unique manager for each item. This inconsistency highlights a logical conflict within the ontology, as it cannot simultaneously satisfy the requirement of having a single manager for each item and having multiple managers for \"ItemA.\"\n"
